                <h3>Light Requirements</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Low Light</dt>
                    <dd>Perfect for Snake Plants and ZZ Plants. These plants can thrive with minimal sunlight, so they're great for rooms with little natural light. Be sure to water sparingly as overwatering can lead to root rot. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight as it can burn the leaves.</dd>
            
                    <dt>Bright Indirect Light</dt>
                    <dd>Ideal for Anthuriums and Money Trees. Place these plants near windows where they get filtered sunlight. Bright but indirect light is perfect as it promotes healthy growth without the risk of sunburn. Avoid direct sun exposure for prolonged periods, as it can cause the leaves to scorch.</dd>
            
                    <dt>Direct Sunlight</dt>
                    <dd>Great for outdoor plants and succulents. Plants like succulents, cacti, and certain flowering plants thrive in full sun. These plants need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day to stay strong and vibrant. Ensure they’re not in too much shade, as lack of sunlight can lead to weak and spindly growth.</dd>

                <h3>Maintenance Levels</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Low Maintenance</dt>
                    <dd>Snake Plants, ZZ Plants, and succulents are some of the easiest to care for. These plants can go for longer periods without water, making them great for beginners or busy people. Ensure they are in a well-draining pot and check the soil before watering. Too much water can lead to root rot, so always let the soil dry out between waterings.</dd>
            
                    <dt>Medium Maintenance</dt>
                    <dd>Philodendrons and Money Trees require a bit more attention. They need regular watering but don't like to sit in soggy soil. Prune them occasionally to remove dead or yellowing leaves. They also appreciate occasional feeding during their growing season to encourage robust growth.</dd>
            
                    <dt>High Maintenance</dt>
                    <dd>Calatheas and Ferns are high-maintenance plants that need consistent care. They require regular watering, high humidity, and a stable environment. These plants are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and need to be kept away from drafty windows or air conditioning. Misting the leaves regularly or using a humidity tray will help keep them healthy.</dd>

                <h3>Common Issues and Solutions</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Root Rot</dt>
                    <dd>Root rot is a common problem caused by overwatering or poor drainage. If you notice a foul smell, yellowing leaves, or mushy roots, your plant may be suffering from root rot. To fix this, carefully remove the plant from its pot and inspect the roots. Trim off any dark, soft, or smelly roots. Let the healthy roots dry out for a few hours before repotting in fresh, dry, well-draining soil. Ensure the new pot has drainage holes, and only water when the top inch of soil feels dry. To prevent root rot, avoid letting your plant sit in excess water. Always empty the saucer beneath the pot after watering.</dd>
            
                    <dt>Yellowing or Dry Leaves</dt>
                    <dd>Yellowing leaves can indicate a variety of issues, including overwatering, underwatering, or too much direct sunlight. Dry, crispy leaves often mean the plant is underwatered or experiencing low humidity. To address these problems, if the leaves are yellow, check the soil moisture. If the soil is soggy, reduce watering and ensure the plant has good drainage. If the soil is dry, increase watering, but ensure it drains well. If the leaves are dry and crispy, this could be a sign of underwatering or low humidity. Increase watering and consider placing the plant on a humidity tray or using a room humidifier. For plants in direct sunlight, move them to a spot with indirect light. Sunburned leaves can appear brown or faded, so be mindful of light exposure.</dd>
            
                    <dt>Bug Infestation</dt>
                    <dd>Pests such as aphids, mealybugs, spider mites, and scale insects can weaken your plant, causing leaf damage and yellowing. To prevent and treat bug infestations, inspect your plants regularly, especially the undersides of leaves and along stems, where pests tend to hide. If you notice pests, isolate the affected plant to prevent spreading. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to treat the plant. Lightly spray the affected areas and repeat every 7-10 days until the pests are gone. For severe infestations, you may need to use a stronger treatment, such as horticultural oil or a chemical pesticide (use with caution). Always follow label instructions carefully. Regularly cleaning your plants’ leaves with a damp cloth can help prevent the buildup of dust and discourage pests.</dd>
